### This project involves the development of a data-driven solution for analyzing and visualizing energy-related data in Germany. The project spans over a period of nine days and encompasses various tasks aimed at achieving the defined objectives. Below is a breakdown of the key activities undertaken each day:



Defined the concept of a Minimal Viable Product (MVP) to guide the project's development.
Set up essential tools such as VSCode, GitHub, Notion, and BigQuery for collaboration and data management.
Initiated exploration of data sources, including the Markstammdatenregister and Energy-Charts.de API.


Downloaded and began working with CSV data files.
Discussed storage options for efficient data management.
Conducted data cleaning and gained an initial understanding of the dataset.
Aligned with the team on tools, substructures, and project goals.


Completed data cleaning processes.
Explored storage options, with a focus on utilizing BigQuery.
Discussed and identified key performance indicators (KPIs) for analysis.
Consolidated data within the BigQuery environment.


Commenced data exploration and analysis, with a focus on solar and wind capacity across different geographical regions.
Joined and aggregated data based on identified KPIs.
Explored segmentation of solar users per location.
Began building meaningful visualizations using Looker.


Continued building visualizations in Looker to represent analyzed data effectively.
Defined corporate identity to maintain consistency in branding and presentation.


Revisited data for additional insights and refinement.
Worked on database design language (DDL) to optimize data storage and retrieval.
Considered prognostic modeling techniques for forecasting 2030 energy targets.


Leveraged Looker Studio for advanced visualization capabilities.
Explored machine learning classification models to enhance analysis.
Optimized Looker maps with new measures and insights.


Structured the narrative for the dashboard, focusing on storytelling through data.
Created diverse visualizations including heatmaps, time series, mixed stacked bar charts, and top 10 districts.
Added additional features such as wind potential and Germany's energy transition progress.


Finalized maps and city dashboards for comprehensive insights.
Ensured consistency in visualizations and defaults for user-friendly navigation.
Created a summary document to showcase the project on GitHub, highlighting the methodology, insights, and outcomes.
Throughout the project, emphasis was placed on effective data management, collaboration, and the creation of insightful visualizations to drive informed decision-making in the energy sector. By leveraging advanced tools and methodologies, the project aimed to provide valuable insights into Germany's energy landscape and its transition towards sustainable practices.
